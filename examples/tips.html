<p><strong>You're in!</strong> Here are a few tips to get the most out of this community:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your server has a web app (like Element Web), you can install it as a <strong>PWA</strong> on your phone for a native app experience. Visit the web URL in your mobile browser, then choose "Add to Home Screen."</li>
<li>You can <strong>hide join/leave messages</strong> in busy rooms. In Element, go to room settings and look for the option to hide member events.</li>
<li>Browse through the different channels — there's more than what shows up by default. Check the <strong>space view</strong> for the full list.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
